# What is XNU?

XNU kernel is part of the Darwin operating system for use in macOS and iOS operating systems. XNU is an acronym for X is Not Unix.
XNU is a hybrid kernel combining the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and a C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit.
XNU runs on x86_64 and ARM64 for both single processor and multi-processor configurations.

## The XNU Source Tree

* `config` - configurations for exported apis for supported architecture and platform
* `SETUP` - Basic set of tools used for configuring the kernel, versioning and kextsymbol management.
* `EXTERNAL_HEADERS` - Headers sourced from other projects to avoid dependency cycles when building. These headers should be regularly synced when source is updated.
* `libkern` - C++ IOKit library code for handling of drivers and kexts.
* `libsa` -  kernel bootstrap code for startup
* `libsyscall` - syscall library interface for userspace programs
* `libkdd` - source for user library for parsing kernel data like kernel chunked data.
* `makedefs` - top level rules and defines for kernel build.
* `osfmk` - Mach kernel based subsystems
* `pexpert` - Platform specific code like interrupt handling, atomics etc.
* `security` - Mandatory Access Check policy interfaces and related implementation.
* `bsd` - BSD subsystems code
* `tools` - A set of utilities for testing, debugging and profiling kernel.

## How to Build XNU

### Building a `DEVELOPMENT` Kernel

```sh
meson setup --cross-file meson/cross/qemu-arm64.ini build
ninja -C build
```
